# Icons Directory

This directory should contain the extension icons in the following sizes:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon32.png` - 32x32 pixels (Windows)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Design Guidelines

The icons should follow the PromptVault brand identity:

- **Style**: Modern, minimal, professional
- **Colors**: Use the accent color #74B9FF (blue) with dark/light variants
- **Symbol**: Consider using a vault, document, or prompt-related icon
- **Background**: Transparent for all sizes
- **Format**: PNG with proper transparency

## Creating Icons

You can create these icons using:
- Adobe Illustrator or Photoshop
- Figma or Sketch
- Free tools like GIMP or Canva
- Online icon generators

Make sure all icons are crisp and readable at their respective sizes, especially the 16px version which appears in the browser toolbar.

## Temporary Solution

For development and testing, you can use placeholder icons or generate simple ones with online tools. The extension will work without custom icons (Chrome will use default ones), but custom icons provide a much better user experience.
